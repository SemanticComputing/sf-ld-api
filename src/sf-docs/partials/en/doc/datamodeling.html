<h1>Data service and data model</h1>

<h2>Publication principles of linked data</h2>

<p>
The Semantic Finlex data publication and service are based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data">Linked Data</a> standards, publication model and best practices of the Semantic Web standardised by W3C. The data publication has been created on the open "7-star" <a href="http://www.ldf.fi/">Linked Data Finland</a> service platform, which extends the <a href="http://5stardata.info/en/">5-star model</a> – traditional in this field – proposed by Tim Berners-Lee. The idea is to encourage data publishers to also document the data models used in the datasets (6th star) and to validate the data by applying such data models (7th star).
</p>

<p>
A key idea behind linked data is to provide a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) – a web address which enables users to search for Semantic Web data in a similar manner to web pages – for all resources. To search for information related to such data, the URI is typed into the address bar of the browser. Alternatively, the identifier can be used programmatically based on the HTTP protocol. The identifier can also be used to enrich data with other data sources in such a manner that the information systems can interpret descriptions in intelligent applications.
</p>

<h2>Modelling as a semantic web</h2>

<p>Another key idea behind linked data involves using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">Resource Description Framework (RDF)</a> data model and notations standardised by W3C for the search and presentation of data. Based on this model, data is presented as a simple semantic web (Knowledge Graph), which harmonises and combines data presentation models used in different data silos, and accurately defines the meaning of data by use of logic. This enables the correct interpretation of data and its automatic enrichment by deducing new information. </p>

<p>
For performing queries on web-form data, W3C has standardised the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL language</a> which resembles the SQL language used in traditional relational databases. Query results can be obtained flexibly in various formats, such as in a table for a human reader or as data in RDF Turtle or JSON format, for programming purposes.
</p>

<h2>The benefits of using open standards</h2>
<p>
Adhering to open standards ensures the continuity of the data service and enables the utilisation of third-party utility programmes and components, such as editors, query systems, inference machines, data analysis and visualisation tools etc. Semantic Finlex can also be used in applications through a special REST interface.
