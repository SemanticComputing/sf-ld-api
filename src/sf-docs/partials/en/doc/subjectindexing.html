<h1>Automatic annotation</h1>
<p>Semantic Finlex contains updated statutes that have been automatically annotated. This means that keywords describing the text of each statute have been determined using external juridical vocabularies. These included the Finnish Collaborative Holistic Ontology KOKO (Finto), the Termbase of Jurisprudence (the Bank of Finnish Terminology in Arts and Sciences) and DBpedia.</p>
<p>The annotation is saved in a separate graph:</p>
<pre>http://data.finlex.fi/annotation/sd/</pre>
<p>with the following feature:</p>
<pre>http://data.finlex.fi/schema/common/autRecSubject</pre>
<p>Each feature contains a URI that refers to one of the external vocabularies used in the service. During the annotation process, keywords have been limited based on their frequency.</p>
